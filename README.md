<h1>COVID-19 Data Analysis Project</h1>
This project performs a comprehensive analysis on COVID-19 data using SQL. It includes data cleaning (handling null values), descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation), and data summarization (total, min, max, sum per month). Percentiles are used to understand data distribution, and correlation analysis explores relationships between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Additionally, linear regression models are computed to estimate the impact of confirmed cases on deaths. Insights are derived from various SQL queries to help identify trends and anomalies in the data.
